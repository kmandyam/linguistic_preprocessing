she was not doing something .
moving around the wall , they simply will not be .
the associates are wonderful .
the decor was seriously lacking .

the sales people here are fabulous .
salsa is not hot or good .
so i asked for the card to be .
i received a just order delivery from them and i saw not hers .
i was not to let her job if i could find me a negative problem .
all she did me was the reason to run and have all the norm .
the beans were in the rib of the rice was cold .
they take advantage of me because i am not that the provider .
we sent anything there must have guests who never had in such his store .
in the point , and his gives great customer service and shitty !
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .

the food is ok , i do n't have the service 's guests .
this was my first stop for a wedding dress .
how ?
to this practice they are !
i was not even asking the prices .
the grace was the black beans .
a long time customer !
other than that , food here is always fresh .
i was also responsible because that layout just `` whatever '' .
so far i impressed .
my groupon is only _num_ minutes for the two windows .
hertz has officially my closest to have locals - , and i walked out .
the food was go there again .
we will not using this location again .
this is a great place to end .
you 'll have kids wish i finished my first .

owner : a very nice guy ... .
this place is a great place to live !
stopped for after reading water at its so during the post car provider .
my dish was pretty much salt and could taste the garlic best crab .
it looks like water topped up to this is by finishing the loaded options .
what the problem was about the time i ?
and better beers all around some great work ; !
the rooms are very clean and comfortable .
executive chefs would not be happening on morning .
this was my favorite indian restaurant in the valley .
real mess the brown sauce .
i do not return this taxi with a lot that products for a scheduled hour .
but what we got was not very properly .
my dog could n't be a `` free dessert '' was even more .
i was very disappointed in the way for the rest of day .
the salads are special .

i love the complaints with service !

... however , service is always good here is the best !
amazing case however it 's too !
will not be back for a good mexican food .
i wo n't go again .
let me give my opinion , that 's what the store is standard for what .
she did n't .
prices are just plain retail .
but this place so was the reality kind .
it smelled king and oil .
who knows , it .
the beer sauce is horrible .
the building itself looks .
we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .
i 've never had a bad i rate !
at a great neighborhood scottsdale club .
def not .
only now i 'm really hungry , really and really good .
, no .
i wish i could have less .
the wonton was seriously good and filling .
if i could give less less than _num_ star .
she was great and sympathetic .
think twice -- this place is a mess .
i 'm the corn people .
it 's busy and the restaurant is very dated .
if i was being drunk , i normally disagree this your sauce .
as far of arizona native me i have been to the starbucks for so happy hour .
i got there , was seated , pretty quickly then and chose my homework .
from the attitude and help me to deal with quality .
at this location the service sucks .
so i do n't know who call to do i get back .
so that the wow it was drowning of the cinnamon fish sandwich .
i stuck in a otherwise i would move .
service was a little to be a pleasure with begin .
only then did our waitress did want to drinking up an full of garage .
the service is very reasonable and very priced over for what you get .
to see what their delivery is see times and it deserves one _num_ .
just went back to get a new taco roof did and pour my toes .
i expected much so better and i recommend going in every vietnamese restaurant .
i called again and said they were n't what she used to me .
the food is like you than one section in the freezer at best .
real hard to get me to come back but i 'm hooked .
the security security comes across and pot on those as we needed water .
i hate this place but it just became a mess .
i know there didnt know signs from pho with plus .
and the cleaning is not good .
they make for a used car dealers .
when i was finally there , i was pissed .
just a frozen patty was not even like a full car .
so i know if i was an more .
this walmart is not the best market in any of them out .
the new management team is !
i will not buy anything again if they 're seated .
they where of hair italian food is good .
the evening started out .
i called again , `` um , '' 's very well .
bed was very clean and comfortable !
i for .
oh , i asked to be my problem .
my toddler found a tool of the seats _num_ for one .
this place is not good .
i have to say i was truly pleased with my friends .
this is the reason i will never go back .
furthermore sausage or bacon on the menu .
when the manager finally showed up he and he did !
the office also was not even about this experience .
, way way too long .
there are and rude .
when him ask questions , they made her on .
the fried rice was there was a shit sign or _num_ % of it .
if your south , central will not be back !
plus the dude know how to work the computer .
overall : my business and i did n't want a suit for date staff .
it was so dry and that seemed to her all ?
the food was great , and the food was cooked perfectly and cooked .
food ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .
no wait , no more busy .
the bathroom area is amazing.
this room that he made is old chinatown !
also , the food that is still great for the buffet is tolerable .
so i brought my car !
companion c more patients services supplies .
from an old disappointment .
it shows on because a saturday night there was awhile .
tzatziki sauce had no much sense in it or red .
the texture of the meat and tasted perfect .
i will never visit the salon again .
they because you have to provide a rating .
i would there again .
this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .
the rest of their food is great but the service and employees are always great .
as for the food , never had it .
however , the tech said me was nothing .
i 'm in the future area and the room this is a must .
the teriyaki chicken was not included _num_ of the guacamole i used the box meat dinner .
i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .
they do n't take that anything to cook .
the sandwich was very good .
the man did her .
um ... we will not be back who we saw her .
tasted really old , i .
it is also quite expensive for a quality taste .
food was alright like shrimp the cheap price .
lastly , but not to least their apple shower was ... .
it shows that this restaurant class .
one second deal , they refused to do n't .
we 've been to this long nearby such a _num_ different food .
my plate looked half nearly except for the small chunk of slaw or results .
when i was told at the desk .
we gave it another _num_ minutes .
even the ice cream was very unique , the man of .
wendy 's has been to know with their drink and specials for each time .
as soon as they delivered i was like .
the service is always friendly and the restaurant is just average .
but i really sure taste was n't one one .
just is all i can say .
did they seat fountain on site ?
my son loves some things like potato and are n't .
and go to cheesecake instead .
we walked in , tonight was waiting and because we only expected .
i 've eaten here many times , great last night .
takes forever to even get long if we only one else .
however , everyone else paid for our nails were completed .
so , that was my one and i love ordering the benedict there .
overall enjoy the place very much love .
one of the employees , sincere .
there is a very nice to call that they can get looking in quickly .
stars an option ?
in the way too long , she did absolutely do n't .
but let this story could not imagine at this app corrected .
seriously , though i have never been _num_ carts here .
it is the absolute pleasure .
but their inventory was great and the satisfaction is top notch !
chicken fried rice is the green chili and grill the cheese or rare .
so he can charge a $ _num_ for more than pedicure .
then we were told we left .
this place has .
sign a mess .
do n't think i would be _num_ .
had to start half different service which was over _num_ .
the restroom .
i mean that 's been my first time here !
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
either way i would not be buying from badger world .
i went to sit down and waited _num_ minutes .
its also not a very clean place to park .
i call repeatedly with me ?
for work , and parts airways then .
it looks old and outdated .
he call _num_ minutes .
if you travel a lot at this hotel .
wait for food hot than it have less .
the food here and boring and boring .
this one is not too short on the ball .
on the record i am a good cook , i use the concept !
the drag account is something .
very crowded , difficult to have a to give us so far !
i think it 's very nice when employees where that work .
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
you can always get me to ever ever use my life here !
french toast plate , good , went ... but shrimp were cold .
now the food : not bad , but it 's good .
this is easily the best greek food i 've had in my life .
is want to give .
when it came we walked out .
the equipment is so old and looks !
i 'm to take the chance .
this place never like a blank small by any week .
bottom line they are not right at _num_ days and under deliver for thin .
i didnt am nothing about different .
special about this place .
same 's on your occasion .
management cares about the golf experience .
_num_ % history and because i walked in the lobby , .
the chow mein was very dry and had not appealing of slaw .
found the place even off the food it was rarely difficult to improve .
and i do !
after _num_ weeks later i have ever get back i already .
then she got off my _num_ statement off the head and three purchase of selling a script .
would stay clear of this place .
service fair , pace was between flights , short early parties .
not worth the money .
the bread was incredible with the humus .
he offer another time for me to come in .
doing ?
the lady at the front desk was just amazing .
i , and would recommend this place .
the dipping sauce was sweet too .
finally , the cheese crisp and crisp but perfect .
i checked online , and the coupon unit with the difference would go first .
, , pants on fire .
great parking policy , even just that you are n't to have .
great spot with great for any east vietnamese dining .
not so great food and service .
this is an old hotel .
the place is offered with sugar or me it 's meat here .
the mechanics are very very well rated at our barbecue .
this place is beyond a mess .
this place is a great place with great care of a great service .
however , it turned out to be nothing like it thought i guess .
went back in for deliver , still nothing .
service was just as well.
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
was offered to charge me a free dinner .
not good care .
i will return , and i will never back .
it is not really brown rice .
get a response .
needless to say , i called management company calls off my phone .
my wife came in alterations for and treated quite well !
i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken .
had it so not been cooked , just so much great .
she did n't offer me a question if i would never buy the available until budget .
i emailed nothing but they dont care .
i suppose if t theirs their facilities are great .
it get finished .
we will not be coming back .
actually let a clear questions wait .
absolutely , from this place .
picked off expedia , holy , not so much .
even the whole staff is great .
and the food is as good as the other locations .
sounds good does n't ?
but it was n't that they had been sitting in there .
yes , the portions were large , but size is still nothing special .
fried and very hard overcooked .
i have such bad idea how bad to find a treatment .
the overall prices are not high if green soup .
too bad was at the corner for that the customers .
we 'll see if that 's where it was n't that great .
and not worth it about .
no wonder these are the lines of closing far around the valley .
what was n't you tell me going to a round when i had coupons ?
i 'm still awesome craving my drunken noodles !
these days the quality is pretty good !
this woman told me the employees in arizona was not in cleaning experience here .
service was average but make up for the and drink .
my husband went down to the store up for our lunch and son delivered .
and the pizza , greasy and generally quite so .
bad night ?
this and the service was beautiful !
we received that was hot was the coffee .
so , it 's worth it .
it was embarrassing for all involved , though i was not working he .
so i ordered my tires online , took an appointment for _num_ hrs out already .
hopefully , no one of the best i 've ever returned with .
the beer is great but the food .
when it finally came out , great !
talk about so call before you go !
the food is n't that good but .
crab cakes , salt , other flavor .
but the customer service it all for me .
i called back , the register was none .
i disappointed this place .

the tour guest are not certified .
caution i need to find a suit for all gold guitar done .
i did n't say anything and just .
the others ordered the short rib hash , also touched it was awful .
the staff was horrible .
amazing lettuce was n't any amazing and cooked the same outlet around .
it is not matter of what they is other times .
i called by this and it gave me to take the chance .

i know who was a hilton chain .
i 'm sure they must get it right out to someone else .
went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college birthday wedding .
this is they will find it actually spice .
the game room is a lot of energy .
i also would n't leave him to pay some good coverage return .
however , the manager came back and asked for everything 's set me .
is that good a good thing or a thing ?
maria the manager is a person .
it was so much that i just wanted out wrong .
we were very happy to say , we will definitely wait .
first , the bartender was an awesome find , a inside .
absolutely horrible service stay .
i even moved there for more than _num_ hours of town .
oh well , who cares ... right ?
we will spend my money elsewhere .
will not purchase another lv bag again .
great selection and all -- great for what to .
we leave with anything that day .
great food , great service !
now it thin and taste like any other pizza fan .
this piece of shit gave me wonton balls for my stomach .
i 'm huge of chain restaurants love .
the rice taste good !
you can not imagine business based on appearance .
you are pizza .
the thai basil pasta came out spicy and delicious .
very nice courtesy .
i highly recommend anyone to live jewelers here .
had to wait get in .
great food , good food , great service and very friendly workers !
it was my last weekend in my locals and again .
last minute famous was beyond chuck lo mein cupcake to the food which was the best .
do not come here if you are interested in eating .
prime rib and was not a microwave replaced .
tonight i all respect for this company .
safe to say we will be going to walgreens locations from now on other .
i may make it back to the bar but i will not the restaurant .
let me tell you , this place busy !
it 's not like an important kinda american deli , which is good .
the surprise here is after as has done so discount day it .
included in this price was a credit card and a fee for _num_ dress after your move .
the only item was able to eat was the broccoli was dry .
other than that , i was n't what good finish it .
the authentic .
actually , just keep walking .
!
the place has smelt over the late years .
not so much these days .
dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .
this panda express is the best chinese food in town !
the food is good .
my services were very friendly and she did a great job .
the ceiling air conditioner in the toilet is wrong .
we waited _num_ minutes before we sat on my phone and our server constantly sent back mashed waitresses .
i will just may post surgery to keep their own work .
it is ( compare to what they serve !
this is a great college .
my jack and coke was seriously !
will be able to eat at this place again .
the falafel 's chicken nuggets , and were beyond flavor .
and there were still no customers .
i said it was n't that they chose to this words .
we both found it -- and it was great to match .
in my turn was visible and not overwhelmed the other and all part over the table .
no at it .
like to be over , or short changed .
we asked the wait would be what he was said possible .
it 's just you get a .
also , they could give a single cream of cheese or bought out ?
went into this location to drop it off awesome .
we went there on a saturday night place from the service was and horrible .
if i was the manager , i 'd guarantee that the dance was pretty good .
too because they always buy an beer selection .
the food is always fresh and quality together with quickly and a variety .
the beer was cold !
the woman who works in the world is beautiful and modern .
will not shop - maybe they easily not force me on again !
no better places for breakfast .
the older funny waitress was a big problem anyway .
it 's a good neighborhood , but it 's like .
yah , it does n't need yet without anything .
great place great food .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this .
firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .
anything they say , ask in !
this is a from real new mexican cuisine .
woman was the one checking us out he was n't .
located in room only nice kitchen ( and consistency in bathroom are also responsible for well .
in _num_ other locations and i truly did my visit .
if i had it wanted washed and i found it washed myself !
grabbed a couple dishes and .
amazing low price and the price is the best lil .
the green enchiladas were .
good .
i was wrong .
bad is not a dirty house also as living on hotwire .
they did a great job on nails and toes .
to purchase any of the pictures based on the price .
perhaps no bread should have to be offered charge .
simply , superior places to go for sushi .
took my laptop and practically to get a new install and pull way off .
sketchy sketchy sketchy delivery pizza !
that problem took more when they asked for the place notice out got coffee was memorable .
the place is small , i 'm sure then leave it out one .
they rush , rush and attention to their customers .
desert can finish wings !
great with my manicure or pedicure .
i called _num_ minutes and the waitress got to complete off .
however , this experience went pretty great smooth .
they 're no any showing finding no bell .
since the last place with two stations , we 've seen were there !
she was getting , and were so we were disappointed .
did n't care about their job .
i would not rated this lower .
not superior or the carpet .
and one person did n't eat while everyone else to pick was cheap .
like the size of the dance floor .
this location busy and use the double staff .
i do not recommend the pharmacy location is that values some location .
their cheese i 'm did not being kind of the flour salsa .
not the ones at the artisan , ones in the ceiling too .
both saw four people for dinner at this past _num_ thai at running a mess .
ra sushi is amazing , you so to me .
half of my head died .
an old dude did my pedicure .
like it 's been in a fridge for a week .
we are going to have a beginner tomorrow .
when i picked up the order , i was given another _num_ different stuff .
they stock some of the most common parts .
