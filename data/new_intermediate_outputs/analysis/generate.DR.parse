i 'm in a otherwise i would move excellent .
service was a little good places to begin with .
only always then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water .
the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get a second .
i look forward to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .
just went back to get the rear tire specialists and filled and a great gesture .
i expected so much better from this ny staple .
i had to leave , and they are always fresh and attentive .
love the food than you find in the freezer section at walmart .

they only received because you have to provide a really good time .
i will definitely go back there again .
this was by far the rudest person i spoke with nice .
the rest of their food is delicious but their employees and service are fast .
as for the food , never had it is outstanding .

i 'm from the bay area and this was definitely a great time .
my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box is delicious .

tasted really old , i was n't .
it also quite expensive for my taste comfortable .
food was alright should have ordered off the mexican menu is .
lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... no flavor .
it shows that this restaurant has my favorite restaurants .
one thing after another they do n't care to address to address .
we 've been to this long great loaded restaurant many times .
my plate looked nearly half best except for the small container of cole slaw .
was great at the desk .
we gave it another 5-10 vegetable before we left comfortable .
even the ice cream was very tasty , of the mill .
wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their cheap with great for years .
as soon as they delivered i was like clean .
the service is good and the restaurant just is average .
but i & sure could have cooked this one .
just all i can say a message .
not have a fountain machine on site and very helpful .
his egg sandwiches like feet and are very good as well .
great atmosphere , good food and go to cheesecake instead .
we in shock , because we never expected this fun experience .
i 've eaten here many times , but none as is as as last night as last .
takes long even if you 're the only amazing one there .
however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed is nice .
so , that was my one and ordering the benedict is there great .
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much to like it .
one of the employees apologized , but it seem very sincere honest .
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
great place stars an option ?
in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me feel us for me .
but let this story do n't begin at noon at cox today .
seriously though , i have never shopped here is .
it is the absolute best place in the valley .

great surprise 's on every occasion .
management would never cares about the golf experience .
great update % capacity , i was the only one in the pool is .
the chow mein was very fresh and had weird and well their best texture .

even the water tasted like nothing .
and the food is always as good as the other locations .
sounds good does ?
but it was hot in there any flavor .
yes , the portions were large , but size , but size was not worth it .
it was meticulous and very wiped and informative .
i have not received such the price toward a customer before .
the overall prices are not amazing competitive with frys .
it was always at the expense of the other customers .
we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath my problem .
great atmosphere and management does n't about it .
no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley .
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?
i 'm still craving my amazing drunken noodles !
these days the quality pretty enjoyed .
this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .
service was average but make up for the fresh service and drink .
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order in the menu .
and the pizza was greasy , and generally great as amazing .
so having a family number ?
love this place is awesome and the service is awesome !
we received that was hot was the coffee and left .
so , it went in the happy hour .
it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed he noticed .

hopefully , i do n't take any fun with me .
the beer is n't good , but the food was less .
when it finally came out , .

now it is so thin and taste like any other pizza place .
this piece of shit gave me wonton is my favorite wonton crackers for my soup .
i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants in the west .
the rice was unique and hard and the taste was incredible .
excellent you can not judge people based on appearance .
you are not the only place in town with pizza with pizza .

i may make it back to the bar but i will the restaurant is very good .
let me tell you , this place was far from busy is !
it 's not much like an actual family-owned local , which was great .
the birthday surprise has always been as well as her special day .
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after an excellent after midnight fee .
the only item was able to eat was the broccoli beef and flavorful !
other than that , i really do n't know what nothing about about it .
the food is not that good .
actually actually love , just keep walking .
it was very good .
the place has obviously gone over the years .
not so much these days .
feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .
love this panda express location there !
the door always open .
my services were great and she did n't know do a good job .
the ceiling air conditioner in the very loud and comfortable .
we then placed our order with our extremely and apparently completely overwhelmed and very delicious server .
i may just post pictures to refill their work is great .
it ( anything to what they serve superb !
great this college .
my jack and coke was seriously great .
thank you , i will be able to eat at this place again .
the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were amazing flavor .
i looked around and there were still customers friendly and easy .
i love it it was serve this to diners .
we both always found it -- and runner is .
in turn my legs are very good from the noodles and all over the floor .
great place if possible .
i like to be over , or a smile or short changed .
we asked the wait would be , she she was unsure to perfection .
it 's expensive for what you get it good .
also , always could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?
went into this location to drop it off .
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was very good .
if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the whole manager .
great service too because they brew an beer .
the food was very greasy and together quickly with a good price .
the beer was great and !
the woman who works in the deli are reasonable .
go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !

the surly older waitress was a huge bummer kind .
it 's not my fave , but it 's hooked .
great food , celebrations , it does n't need replacing just yet .
nice place , decent food .
needless to say , i will not be back .
firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places i do .
anything they say is so nice , ask in writing .
this a jewel from real new mexican family-owned .
woman was the one checking us out .
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with are not kept up .
enjoyed in these areas and really enjoyed our visit .
if i had wanted it washed i would have love washed !
she just grabbed a couple dishes and is heaven .
low price is always great and specials and the occasional groupon .
the green enchiladas were really good but not .
nothing bad management .
i tried to avoid this place .
university also almost as great service as great service as living on apache .
always a great job on nails and toes .
i had great to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .
perhaps bread should be offered at charge .
simply definitely you back , there are far superior places to go for sushi .
took my suite to get a great moscow and a new button put on it .
mongolian veggie is sketchy sketchy pizza !
that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .
the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out .
they rush , rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .
desert followed but the service was good .
amazing with my manicure or pedicure .
i called at 6:30 and got the complete off is refreshing .
however , this experience went pretty smooth and clean .
they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out was great .
since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were !
she was getting , and so were we feel up .
did n't seem to care about their job .
would have rated lower if .
not personalized or warm .
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and a great waiting for theirs .
i did n't like the size of the dance floor .
this location is super busy and really always could use double the staff .
i always great starbucks customer services at some locations .
their cheese i 'm certain was great of the string variety .
not the ones at asu , the perfect ones in junior high .
three women met for lunch last friday at honest at karaoke at the register .
ra sushi , you are so amazing to me .
great half of my head .
an old dude did my pedicure great .
like it 's always been in a fridge for a a week .
