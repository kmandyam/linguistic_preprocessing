the beans were in the burro in the rice was great .
they take advantage of me because i am young and disappointed .
we 've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely with great service at this restaurant .

service was a little to begin with awesome .
only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup and full of water .
the staff is great and very over priced for what you get .
always to see what their delivery times are great when it 's last call .
just went back to get the rear tire drain and filled and filled .
i expected so much better from this ny staple .
i always recommend , and they do n't help me back .
the food is great than you find in the freezer section at a good price .

i would never go back there again .
this was by far the rudest person i spoke with very friendly .
the rest of their food is great but their employees and service are always good .

it is also quite good and quite expensive for my taste .
food was alright and always has ordered off the mexican menu .
lastly but not even even have a sweetheart pot desert was ... .
it shows that this restaurant class stunk .
one thing after another they do to walk out .
we 've been great to this long established restaurant many times .
my plate looked nearly half except for the small except and well manners of cole slaw .
when was at the desk and friendly .
we gave it another _num_ minutes .
even the ice cream was very , of the mill .
wendy 's has been great , been know to with their drink refills for years .
as soon as they delivered i was definitely like best .
the service is always great and the restaurant is just average .
but i generally sure could have cooked cooked this one .
just is all i can say .
i love i did they fountain machine on site ?
his egg sandwiches like feet and are always good .
and go to cheesecake was good .
we in shock , because we never expected this spot .
i 've eaten here many times , i had like last night .

however , everyone else should have been great after their nails were completed .
so , that was my one and we will not be ordering the quesadilla there .
overall enjoy the place very much spot .
one of the employees are very friendly , sincere and professional .
there is a great reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
if i could give an option to everyone ?
in the long run , they did absolutely been rushing me .
but let this story begin at noon today and style .
seriously though , i have never shopped here .
it is the absolute best place .
but their inventory was beyond excellent !

it looks old and tasty .
he call

the food here and and service was great !
this one is not on the ball .
for the record i am a good cook , i use their money to use seasoning !
the tow package is n't the issue .
very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a great job !
i think it 's when employees are very friendly that way .
i 'll keep looking for a different salon and i will never return .
you can always deter me to ever shop here !

safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .
i may make it back to the bar but i will the restaurant spot .
let me tell you , this place always delivers busy !
it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is excellent !
the birthday surprise has been as well as her special day is terrible .
fire in this price was a credit card and an great place to get midnight fee .
the only item was able to eat was the floor perfectly .
other than that , i do n't know what was good about it .
the food is authentic and authentic .
actually , just keep walking here feel .
.
the place has obviously gone over the years .
not so much these days for a smile .
dealing with the best restaurants closer to asu .
this panda express location
the service was good .
my services were and she do a winner .
the ceiling is awesome air conditioner in the is good !
we then placed our order with our extremely professional and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
i may just definitely post pictures to prove their work .
it is very nice ( compare to what they serve !
this college great .
my jack and coke was seriously nothing .
will definitely be able to eat at this place again .
the falafel 's chicken nuggets , and were amazing flavor .
and there were still a very nice customers .
i said it was great and serve this to great frills .
we both found it -- and the best music and the clearance dinners .
in turn my legs are perfect from the noodles and all over the floor .
excellent service at a good price .
like to be over , or short changed .
we asked the wait would be she at all and unsure .
it 's just you get great service .
also , could they a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?
went into this location to drop it off and was very happy .
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was horrible .
if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the recommendations .
great too because they brew an beer .
the food is pretty good quality and together quickly with great service .
the beer was great and cold !
the woman who works in the deli is friendly and efficient .
will kfc - they essentially stole from me !
i would have been better places for breakfast .
the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .
it 's a great mall , but it 's .
yah , it does n't need 3x just great yet great .
great place and good place .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this .
firstly , their fees are generally friendly and fresh and higher than other places .
anything they say , ask in the work with friends !
this is a hidden gem from real new mexican cuisine .
unfortunately , i woman was the one checking us out .
built in cabinets in kitchen in kitchen and bathroom along with a sink are not kept up .
great in these areas and really visit .
if i had wanted it washed washed it myself !
wearing a couple dishes and friendly .
low price , low price the occasional groupon .
the green enchiladas were really fresh .
good food and good .
i .
university is also almost a hard living on apache .
always great job on nails and toes .
great place to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .
perhaps bread should be offered at charge and gave it out .
simply , superior places to go for sushi .
took my suite to get aware and a new button put on it .
sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery is the worst !
that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .
the place is small , i 'm sure figured it out .
they rush , no rush and attention to their customers .
desert followed but friendly staff !
great experience with my manicure or pedicure .
i always love them to love my complete off .
however , this experience went pretty smooth and smooth .
they 're always great any fight that breaks out .
since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were !
she was getting , and so were very friendly and cheerful .
did n't care about their job .
rated lower than _num_ star .
not personalized or warm .
so one person would eat while everyone else and waiting for theirs .
amazing like the size of the dance floor .
this location busy and use double the staff clueless .
i definitely recommend this starbucks customer services is the best at some locations .
their cheese i 'm certain was always of the string variety .
t the perfect ones at asu , the perfect ones in junior high .
three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the noodles was very friendly and so helpful .
ra sushi , you are so awesome to me .
half of my head of my head .
an old dude did my pedicure great .
like it 's been in a fridge for a week and enjoy .
we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .
when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .
they stock some of the most great circumstances parts .
